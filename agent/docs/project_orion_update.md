1. Project Scope
----------------
Project Orion focuses on an automated robotic arm station capable of picking, orienting, and sorting un-singulated parcel packages and e-commerce SKUs directly from conveyor belts into sortation bins.

2. Hardware Architecture & Edge Compute
---------------------------------------
- Manipulator: Universal Robots UR10e 6-axis cobot arm.
- End-Effector: Custom pneumatic vacuum suction array with active flow sensing.
- Vision Sensors: Dual Intel RealSense D435i stereo depth sensors paired with an overhead Basler ace 2 gigabit color camera.
- Edge Compute Engine: NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX (64GB) module running real-time TensorRT model inference for 6-DoF pose estimation.

3. Performance Benchmarks
-------------------------
- Target Cycle Time: 2.8 seconds per pick-and-place cycle.
- Current Achieved Time: 3.1 seconds (reduced from 3.6s following TensorRT optimization).
- Pick Success Rate: 96.2% on standard corrugated boxes; 89.1% on deformable polybags.

4. Key Deadlines
----------------
- System integration with Project Atlas fleet dispatcher: October 28, 2026.
- Formal Factory Acceptance Test (FAT): November 12, 2026.
